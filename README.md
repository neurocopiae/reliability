fMRelI_beta0.1

1. Please download all files in your desired toolbox directory. 
2. The files 'atlas.nii', 'atlas.txt' and 'labels.mat' have to be in a subfolder called 'atlas'. 
3. If you like structure, you can add 'create_xSPM.m', 'fmri_clust_filt.m', 'id.mat', 'load_nii.m', 'save_nii.m' and 'template_3D-4D.mat' to a folder called 'scripts_templates'. 
4. Anyway, the toolbox directory and all subfolders need to be added to the matlab path.
